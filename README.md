Here are some details of my work on the challenge:
- From the provided Progam.cs file, I set variable maxSurvivalFloor to 1 instead of 0.
- Created a for loop to traverse through the number of attempts.
- (MaxSurvivalFloor - 1) returns the correct number of floors before the phone cracks.
- Printed the number of floors before a crack and asked the user if they want to run a new test.
